# Episode 4: How functions work in JS & Variable Environment 

## How functions work in JavaScript ‚ù§Ô∏è

- Functions in JavaScript create their own execution contexts when invoked.
- Each function has its own variable environment (Memory Component), allowing the use of local variables that are scoped within the function.
- Variables declared within a function are accessible only within that function, unless explicitly returned or accessed from an outer scope ( This is possible through the concept of closures in JavaScript-[will come in later Ep]).
- JavaScript uses a process called variable hoisting, which allows functions to be called before they are defined. The variable declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase.

## Variable Environment

- The variable environment (Memory Component) of an execution context is the space where variables and functions are stored during runtime.
- Each execution context has its own variable environment (Memory Component), which holds the variables and functions specific to that context.
- When a variable is accessed, JavaScript searches for its value first in the local variable environment and then in the outer variable environments until it reaches the global variable environment.
- This hierarchical structure of variable environments allows for lexical scoping, where variables are resolved based on their proximity to the current execution context.

## Code Flow in terms of Execution Context

```js
var x = 1;
a();
b(); // we are calling the functions before defining them. This will work properly, as seen in Hoisting.
console.log(x);

function a() {
  var x = 10; // local scope because of separate execution context
  console.log(x);
}

function b() {
  var x = 100;
  console.log(x);
}

//Output
// 10
// 100
// 1
```

1. The code begins with the declaration `var x = 1;`. This creates a variable `x` in the global execution context with the initial value of `1`.
2. Next, we encounter the function invocation `a();`. Since functions in JavaScript create their own execution contexts, a new execution context is created for the function `a()`.
3. Within the execution context of `a()`, we see the declaration `var x = 10;`. This creates a separate variable `x` with the initial value of `10` in its own variable environment (Memory Component), which is scoped locally within the function `a()`.
4. The statement `console.log(x);` within `a()` outputs the value of the local `x`, which is `10`.
5. After `a()` finishes executing, its execution context is popped off the call stack, and we return to the global execution context.
6. The function invocation `b();` is encountered. Similar to `a()`, a new execution context is created for `b()`.
7. Within the execution context of `b()`, we have the declaration `var x = 100;`, creating a separate variable `x` with the value `100` within the local scope of `b()`.
8. The statement `console.log(x);` within `b()` outputs the value of the local `x`, which is `100`.
9. Once `b()` completes execution, its execution context is popped off the call stack, and we return to the global execution context.
10. Finally, we encounter the statement `console.log(x);` within the global scope. Since there is no local `x` variable in this scope, JavaScript accesses the global `x` variable declared earlier, which has a value of `1`.
11. The value of `x` is outputted as `1` to the console.
