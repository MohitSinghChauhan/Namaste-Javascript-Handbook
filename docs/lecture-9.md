# Episode 9 : Block Scope & Shadowing in JS

What is a **Block**?

- Block aka _compound statement_ is used to group JS statements together into 1 group. We group them within {...}

  ```js
  {
    var a = 10;
    let b = 20;
    const c = 30;
    // Here let and const are hoisted in Block scope,
    // While, var is hoisted in Global scope.
  }
  ```

- Block Scope and its accessibility example

  ```js
  {
    var a = 10;
    let b = 20;
    const c = 30;
  }
  console.log(a); // 10
  console.log(b); // Uncaught ReferenceError: b is not defined
  ```

  - Reason?

    - In the BLOCK SCOPE; we get b and c inside it initialized as _undefined_ as a part of hoisting (in a seperate memory space called **block**)
    - While, a is stored inside a GLOBAL scope.

    - Thus we say, _let_ and _const_ are BLOCK SCOPED. They are stored in a separate mem space which is reserved for this block. Also, they can't be accessed outside this block. But var a can be accessed anywhere as it is in global scope. Thus, we can't access them outside the Block.

What is **Shadowing**?

- ```js
  var a = 100;
  {
    var a = 10; // same name as global var
    let b = 20;
    const c = 30;
    console.log(a); // 10
    console.log(b); // 20
    console.log(c); // 30
  }
  console.log(a); // 10, instead of the 100 we were expecting. So block "a" modified val of global "a" as well. In console, only b and c are in block space. a initially is in global space(a = 100), and when a = 10 line is run, a is not created in block space, but replaces 100 with 10 in global space itself.
  ```

- So, If one has same named variable outside the block, the variable inside the block _shadows_ the outside variable. **This happens only for var**

- Let's observe the behaviour in case of let and const and understand it's reason.

  ```js
  let b = 100;
  {
    var a = 10;
    let b = 20;
    const c = 30;
    console.log(b); // 20
  }
  console.log(b); // 100, Both b's are in separate spaces (one in Block(20) and one in Script(another arbitrary mem space)(100)). Same is also true for *const* declarations.
  ```

  ![Block Scope Explaination](../assets/scope.jpg 'Lexical Scope')

- Same logic is true even for **functions**
  ```js
  const c = 100;
  function x() {
    const c = 10;
    console.log(c); // 10
  }
  x();
  console.log(c); // 100
  ```

What is **Illegal Shadowing**?

- ```js
  let a = 20;
  {
    var a = 20;
  }
  // Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared
  ```
  - We cannot shadow let with var. But it is **valid** to shadow a let using a let. However, we can shadow var with let.
  - All scope rules that work in function are same in arrow functions too.
  - Since var is function scoped, it is not a problem with the code below.
    ```js
    let a = 20;
    function x() {
      var a = 20;
    }
    ```
